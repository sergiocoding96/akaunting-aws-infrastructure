# Architecture Diagram Generation

The `architecture.drawio` file in this repository contains the source for the architecture diagram. To generate the PNG version for use in the README:

1. Open the file with [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
2. Go to File > Export as > PNG
3. Save the file as `architecture.png` in the repository root

Once saved, commit and push the PNG file to the repository. The README.md file is already configured to display the architecture diagram from the expected location.
